  - `POST /api/alerts` - Create new alerts
  - `GET /api/alerts` - Get user alerts with filtering
  - `GET /api/alerts/upcoming` - Get alerts due in next 7 days
  - `PATCH /api/alerts/:id/read` - Mark alerts as read
  - `PATCH /api/alerts/:id` - Update alert details
  - `DELETE /api/alerts/:id` - Delete alerts
  - `POST /api/alerts/generate` - Auto-generate alerts based on user data
  - `GET/PUT /api/alerts/settings` - Manage alert preferences

- **Service Layer** (`/backend/services/smartAlertsService.js`)
  - Comprehensive alert management logic
  - Automatic alert generation based on:
    - Budget threshold breaches (80%+ of monthly budget)
    - Goal progress milestones (80%+ completion)
    - Emergency fund low warnings (below 50% target)
    - Time-sensitive goal deadlines
  - Alert filtering and sorting capabilities

#### Alert Types Supported
- **Bill Reminders** - Credit cards, utilities, loans

- **Market Updates** - Price alerts, investment opportunities

#### Database Schema
- `smart_alerts` table with comprehensive fields
- `alert_settings` table for user preferences
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies implemented
- Proper indexing for performance

### 2. Financial Health Score System

#### Comprehensive Scoring Algorithm
- **Overall Score Calculation** with weighted components:
  - Financial Literacy (20% weight)
  - Savings Rate (20% weight)  
  - Debt Management (15% weight)
  - Insurance Coverage (10% weight)
  - Emergency Fund (20% weight)
  - Investment Activity (15% weight)

#### Backend Implementation
- **API routes** (`/backend/routes/financialHealth.js`)
  - `GET /api/health-score` - Get latest score
  - `POST /api/health-score/calculate` - Calculate new score
  - `GET /api/health-score/history` - Score trend analysis
  - `GET /api/health-score/breakdown` - Detailed component analysis
  - `GET /api/resilience/insights` - Personalized recommendations

- **Service Layer** (`/backend/services/financialHealthService.js`)
  - Sophisticated scoring algorithms for each component
  - Personalized recommendations based on score levels
  - Risk assessment and improvement suggestions
  - Historical trend analysis

#### Score Components Detail

1. **Financial Literacy Score (0-100)**
   - Based on completed learning modules
   - Considers completion percentage and module diversity
   - Bonus points for advanced topics

2. **Savings Score (0-100)**
   - Analyzes last 3 months savings rate
   - Considers consistency and savings goals
   - Benchmarked against recommended 10-20% savings rate

3. **Debt Score (0-100)**
   - Evaluates debt-to-income ratio
   - Higher scores for lower debt burdens
   - Considers EMI payments and credit utilization

4. **Insurance Score (0-100)**
   - Ideal range: 2-5% of income spent on insurance
   - Considers health, life, and property insurance
   - Penalties for under-insurance or over-insurance

5. **Emergency Fund Score (0-100)**
   - Target: 6 months of expenses
   - Progressive scoring based on coverage months
   - Critical for financial resilience

6. **Investment Score (0-100)**
   - Based on investment rate as % of income
   - Considers investment diversity and consistency
   - Encourages systematic investment plans (SIPs)

### 3. Database Schema

#### Tables Created
- `smart_alerts` - Alert storage and management
- `resilience_scores` - Financial health scores with history
- `transactions` - User financial transactions
- `goals` - User financial goals and targets
- `user_progress` - Learning module completion tracking
- `alert_settings` - User notification preferences
- `user_profiles` - Extended user information

#### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- User-specific data access policies
- Proper authentication integration with Supabase Auth

### 4. Frontend Integration

#### Services Created
- `smartAlertsAPI.ts` - Complete API integration for alerts
- `financialHealthAPI.ts` - Financial health score integration
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

#### Dashboard Integration
- Real-time financial health score display
- Recent alerts notifications
- Score component breakdown visualization
- Refresh and recalculation capabilities
